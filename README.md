# Soccer ball game

This is a game like Red Ball but I changed the ball type to a soccer ball.
It contains cube obejcts with grass texture and red spikes what makes the game restart.

Press F1 to close and open the guide.
Use the W,A,S,D,Q,E keys and the mouse to move the camera.
Use the + or â€“ keys to change the brightness of the light.
Use the J,L,I keys to move the ball.
Use the R key to reset the camera, the ball and the lights.
Use the arrow keys to move the camera and the ball at the same time.
